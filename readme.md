Employee manager
========================

**Dependencies**: PHP 7.1; phpunit 3.7.21;

**Usage**: Run from CLI(tested with git bash) "php employee-manager.php


**Missing due to time**: 

1)Need to rework the CRUDI methods to make them unit-testable

2)Need to make use of .env or login procedure to provide credentials safely

3)UpdateById method would make sense to allow for more control in editing duplicates out.

4)A lot more clean-up would be nice. There is still a little too much repeater code.
